      <h1>My reasons</h1>  
    </section>
    <section class="card" id="my-reasons2" data-index="7">
      <h2>Why did I choose application development?</h2>
      <p>I have been fascinated by computers and computer science <strong>since childhood</strong>. Thanks to my <strong>father, who showed me the IT sphere</strong>, I came into contact with programming early and began experimenting at the <strong>age of seven</strong>. Since then,<br>I have regularly pursued new ideas with great enthusiasm. <strong>Several internships</strong> have confirmed my career goal and shown me that I am especially passionate about <strong>application development</strong>. The blend of planning, implementation, and creativity excites me, which is why I am applying for an <strong>apprenticeship</strong> as a <strong>computer scientist EFZ</strong> in <strong>application development</strong> for <strong>summer 2026</strong>.</p>
      <h2>Why do I want to work at Siemens?</h2>
      <p>I have already heard <strong>many positive things</strong> about your company from friends who completed an <strong>internship</strong> at Siemens. These impressions strengthened my wish to pursue my apprenticeship at a <strong>leading international company</strong>.<br>I especially value the wide range of <strong>training opportunities</strong> and the possibility of obtaining a <strong>vocational baccalaureate</strong>.</p>

      <h1>How was this website created?</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="card" id="how2" data-index="9">
      <p>This microsite was built by <strong>Leo Orlovsky</strong>, <strong>Maksym Chubatyuk</strong>, and <strong>Max MÃ¼nch</strong> using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We collaborated in <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> with the <strong>Live Share</strong> and <strong>Live Server</strong> extensions to work together in real time. <strong>Leo designed the site</strong>, <strong>created the base</strong>, and handled the <strong>main programming</strong>. <strong>Max wrote the content</strong> based on Leo's drafts, solved some <strong>link-handling</strong> and <strong>appearance issues</strong>, and <strong>suggested some ideas</strong>.<br><strong>Maksym</strong> contributed by <strong>debugging</strong> and bringing in <strong>fresh ideas</strong> to improve the project. The result is a simple, clean, and responsive site with smooth animations and a design inspired by <strong>Apple's new "Liquid Glass" design language</strong>.</p>

<!--    
Coding non-stop for the past four days, for about five hours each day.
I am exhausted but proud. It was really something new and the best website that I have coded till now.
I could do it better and better, I still see where and how I could improve it, but I don't have the time, I have to send it to you and just hope that you will like it. 
The idea of making a microsite came to me 4 days ago when I was thinking how to make my application stand out. I learned a lot of new things, especially in JS, and I am sure that this knowledge will be very useful for me in the future. 
  Leo Orlovsky.
